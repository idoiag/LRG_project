The program runs several tests to test the input and if an output can be provided
  
    a) Tests (Control BRCA1)
    1. LRG_ID: check if the given gene has an allocated LRG ID
     2. Strain: check the direction of the strand. - IP
     3. Build_number: check the number of build provided. If more than one, check that coordinates are diff. 
     4. Build_coor: check that the start and end of the coordinate for each build are different
     5. Data_consistency: check that coordinates extracted are numbers
     6. Exon_coor: check that exons do not overlap
     7. Exon_number: check that we get the right number of exons
     8. Check the schema version - DONE
     10. Build_number: check the 
     9. Check the LRG exists and is a readable file - DONE but it might be superfluous. There is already a CL in-built system
     
     
    b) modules
      1. Access the LRG-sequence.org with an specific Gene name
